This application is a simple chatbot built using Python's Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and JSON for storing its knowledge. The user can type messages in a text input field, and the chatbot replies by searching for the closest matching response in the knowledge base, stored in a knowledge.json file. If a match is found, the bot returns the corresponding answer; if not, it provides a default message indicating it doesn't understand the input.

Key Features:
User Interface (UI):
The app features a clean, minimalist interface with a chat window, a text entry field for user input, and a "Send" button.
The chat area displays both user and bot messages with different colors for easy differentiation.
A scrollbar is provided for scrolling through the chat history.

Message Handling:
When the user submits a message (either by pressing the "Enter" key or clicking the "Send" button), the message is added to the chat window.
The bot uses Python's difflib.get_close_matches() function to find the closest matching entry in the knowledge base and responds with the corresponding text.
If no match is found, the bot replies with a default message: "Sorry, I don't know how to respond to that."

Knowledge Base:
The chatbot loads a JSON file (knowledge.json) containing predefined responses for various inputs.
The bot matches the user's message (converted to lowercase) with keys in the knowledge base and returns the first response for the closest match.

Design and Interaction:
The interface uses a dark theme with contrasting colors for readability and visual appeal.
The "Send" button has hover effects for better interactivity.
The chat window is scrollable, allowing the user to review previous messages.

Purpose:
The application serves as a simple chatbot that allows users to engage in text-based interactions. Its purpose is to provide basic conversational responses based on predefined knowledge, with room for expansion through more sophisticated natural language processing or additional data.
